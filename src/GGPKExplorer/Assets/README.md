# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets used by the GGPK Explorer application.

## Files

### poe-logo.svg
- Path of Exile inspired logo in SVG format
- Used in the application title bar and sidebar
- Black and white design that adapts to theme colors
- Scalable vector format for crisp display at any size

## Usage

The logo is embedded directly in XAML using Canvas and Path elements for optimal performance and theme integration. The SVG file serves as a reference for the design.

## Design Notes

The logo is inspired by Path of Exile's geometric aesthetic, featuring:
- Circular outer ring
- Inner geometric pattern with angular lines
- Central diamond shape
- Corner accent points
- Monochrome design that works with both light and dark themes

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar has been simplified to focus on core functionality:
- **Game Patcher** (Shield icon) - Main GGPK file exploration and patching interface
- **Settings** (Settings icon) - Application configuration and preferences (fully wired to open settings dialog)

The design emphasizes the patching/modding aspect of the application while maintaining a clean, focused interface. The settings button is fully functional and opens the main application settings dialog when clicked.
